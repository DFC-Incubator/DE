# metadactyl-clj

metadactyl-clj is a platform for hosting App Services for the Discovery Environment web application.

Once running, endpoint documentation may be viewed by navigating a web browser to the server and
port this service is configured to run on. For example, if the service were configured as described
in the [Primary Configuration docs](doc/install.md#primary-configuration), then viewing
http://localhost:65007 in a browser would display the documentation of all available endpoints.
