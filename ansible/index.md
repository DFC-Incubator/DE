## Using this Repository

This repository is organized with group_vars defined with some default values in`
inventories/group_vars/all`, with the intention that these playbooks are used with inventory 
created in this `inventories` directory (use a `.cfg` extension to prevent committing the files) and
group_vars files containing private and overriding values in a top-level `group_vars` directory.
